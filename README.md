Prerequisites:
- If you use Next.JS at least version 9.3.x
- React and React-dom (16.13.x)
- npm install sass (latest implementation dart-sass)
- There is no need to use preprocessors like node-sass-chockidar. React team has built in the sass-loader in last updates.

Use xprog-ds on your project:
- npm install xprog-ds
- Create index.scss file (here goes your stylesheet import [@forward 'xprog-ds/styles']
- Create router.scss file (here goes all imports from your components [@forward 'path-to-component']
- Import router.scss in your root index.js file (pages.js for next)
- For every file SCSS you want to use the xprog-ds you must `@use 'path-to-your-index.scss' as *`;
